# Grid Trading Bot

Automated cryptocurrency trading bot that profits from market volatility by buying low and selling high at predefined price levels.

## What is Grid Trading?

Grid trading splits a price range into levels. The bot automatically buys when price drops to each level, then sells when price rises.

**Example**: ETH grid from $4000-$4500 with $100 steps
- Buy at $4000 ‚Üí Sell at $4100
- Buy at $4100 ‚Üí Sell at $4200
- Buy at $4200 ‚Üí Sell at $4300
- And so on...

![Levels trading example](docs/assets/grid_orders.png "Trading by levels")

Each level operates independently, capturing profits as price moves up and down within the range.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Server with Linux and fixed IP address (to whitelist in Binance)
- Docker & Docker Compose
- USDT in Binance Spot account

### Clone the project

```
git clone git@github.com:asidko/grid-trading-bot.git
cd grid-trading-bot
```

### Initialize Configuration

```bash
make init
```

Edit `.env` with your Binance API credentials:
- `BINANCE_API_KEY` - Your API key (required)
- `BINANCE_API_SECRET` - Your API secret (required)
- Link: https://www.binance.com/en/my/settings/api-management. Make sure to enable Spot Trading permissions (you have also provide your IP to allow this option).

### Start Services

```bash
make up
```

Services run on localhost:
- Grid Trading: 8080
- Order Assurance: 9090
- Price Monitor: 7070

### Calculate Profit

Before creating levels, estimate your profit:

```bash
# Just a calculator, bot won't do any actions here
make calc
```

Example:
```
Buy price: 3500
Sell price: 3700
Buy amount USDT: 1000

Step: 200 | Profit: 55.23 USDT (5.52%)
```

### Create Grid Levels

```bash
make levels
```

Interactive prompts will guide you through setup. Example grid:
- Symbol: ETHUSDT
- Min price: 3500
- Max price: 4500
- Grid step: 200
- Buy amount: 1000 USDT

This creates 5 levels at: 3500, 3700, 3900, 4100, 4300

### Check Status

```bash
make status
```

Shows your trading performance:

### Other tips

#### Check what levels are active right now

Check levels with any status other than "ready" (to get levels where we're waiting for buy or sell at the moment):

```bash
sqlite3 -header -column .grid-trading-data/grid_trading.db "SELECT buy_price, sell_price, buy_amount, filled_amount, state, updated_at FROM grid_levels WHERE state <> 'READY';"
```

#### Check last transactions

```bash
# Select any last transactions
sqlite3 -header -column .grid-trading-data/grid_trading.db "SELECT created_at, symbol, side, status, target_price, amount_usdt, profit_usdt FROM transactions ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10;"
```

```bash
# Select last sell transactions
sqlite3 -header -column .grid-trading-data/grid_trading.db "SELECT s.created_at, s.symbol, b.target_price as buy_price, s.target_price as sell_price, s.amount_usdt, s.profit_usdt FROM transactions as s JOIN transactions as b ON b.id = s.related_buy_id  WHERE s.side='SELL' and s.
status='FILLED' ORDER BY s.created_at DESC LIMIT 10;"
```

#### I changed my mind and want to use other levels or symbol

1. Delete all levels from database:

```bash
# Delete all levels from grid_levels table - the bot won't be able to trade anymore
sudo sqlite3 .grid-trading-data/grid_trading.db "DELETE FROM grid_levels;"

# (optionally) Delete all transactions from transactions table to clear the trading history
sudo sqlite3 .grid-trading-data/grid_trading.db "DELETE FROM transactions;"
```

2. Go to Binance Spot and cancel all active orders for the symbol (‚ÄºÔ∏è you may want to leave the last sell order to sell what you have bought).

3. To create new levels:

```bash
# Run levels creation again
make levels
```
